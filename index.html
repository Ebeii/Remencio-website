         <p>Bright and delicate as a sunflower she is. Remencio Kawat a beautiful soul, she has strenght and resilience, as well as grace and beauty. 
            From a mix parentage of Morobe, Chimbu and Jiwaka. Oh, she is something you would like to look at every day.   
            She has a skin tone like the colour of a beautiful glowing sunflower, which you can't take your sight off.     
             What a art she is, I don't know how her parent create such a unique beauty. </p>

             <p>She loves watching Korean Drama and she is very much obsessed with K-Pop, especially with BTS. 
                Sometimes I think she loves K-pop more than me, its funny but I do get jealous about it.
                I don't know why she likes wearing black, while her favorite colour is aquamarine blue. Oh yeah she loves wearing black hoodies, and does not like socializing. 
                She is all into herself coze she's an introvert, but she is full of good vibes if you really know her.
                 I dont mean all the time because she's a headache Sometimes, but you know it is hard to get tired of something beautiful.
                 Not just an ordinary beauty, am talking about beauty that will put a smile on your face even if you're mad at her.</p>

                 <p>She does not like eating alot because she is picky when it comes to food, but she does not pick when it comes to me. 
                    I guess probably am her most favoured food, sounds funny right. 
                    Apart from me she likes spicy food, especially an Korean noodles Kimchi.
